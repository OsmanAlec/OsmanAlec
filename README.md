Hi, Iâ€™m Osman

I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys everything from game development, trading, and ethical hacking to a good game of chess. And while I'm quite good at breaking others' software, I've found my most vocal debugging sessions happen when my own code decides to rebel.

## Featured Projects

**Anterric**
A rogue-like dungeon crawler, story-driven video game that earned **first place at Games Fleadh**. Built as part of a team over the course of 2 months.

**Local Business Websites**
I've built a couple of websites using **Next.js**, actively listening to client and customer feedback for iteration and maintenance.

## Exciting Projects in the Works

**Quantaview**
A trading web application I'm developing to help traders efficiently track their portfolios.

**ReFridge**
Working as part of a team, I'm developing a mobile app for ReFridge. This app will enable users to pre-order from food pantries, save preferred locations, find nearby pantries, and use in-app payments.

**World Recipes**
Currently in the design stage, more details will be revealed soon!
